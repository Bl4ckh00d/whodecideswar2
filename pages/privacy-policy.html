<p class="c5"><span class="c3">To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.</span></p>

<p class="c5"><span class="c3">To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or other requirements.</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c3">By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for compliance purposes. In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see ‘Your legal rights’ below.</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c3">In some circumstances we will anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-style="text-decoration: underline;">YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c3">You have the right to make a complaint at any time to a supervisory authority, in particular to the supervisory authority which regulates the Member State of your habitual residence, your place of work, or the Member State in which the alleged infringement of your rights took place if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you has infringed the terms of the GDPR.</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c3">We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to deal with your concerns before you approach your supervisory authority, so please contact us in the first instance.</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c3">As a data subject, you have a number of rights in relation to your personal data. Below, we have described the various rights that you have, as well as how you can exercise them.</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="c7 c18">Right of access</span></span><span class="c3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span> You may request access to your processed personal data. This entitles you to obtain a copy of the data we hold on you. A copy will be provided by the controller unless it is found that providing a copy will adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</span></p>
<p class="c20 c13 c16"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="c7 c18">Right of rectification</span></span><span class="c3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span> You may request the correction of any personal data that we hold about you.

<p class="c0 c13 c16"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="c7 c18">Right to restrict processing</span></span><span class="c3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span> You may request us to restrict the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances.

You have the right if you: (i) contest the accuracy of the personal data; (ii) the processing is unlawful; (iii) you believe there is no longer a use by us of your personal data and require access for legal claims; or (iv) you exercise your right to object (see below).</span></p>
<p class="c0 c13 c16"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="c7 c18">Right to erasure/ Right to be forgotten</span></span><span class="c3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span> You may request the erasure of your personal data.

<p class="c0 c13 c16"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="c7 c18">Right to withdraw consent</span></span><span class="c3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span> Where we are relying on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. This will not however, affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdrew your consent.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c13 c16"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="c7 c18">Right to object</span></span><span class="c3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span> You may object to the processing of your personal data at any time. This means that you can stop us from using your data. Please note, this right only arises in certain circumstances including: (i) where we rely on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) to process your data; (ii) for scientific, historical or statistical purposes; or (iii) for direct marketing purposes. Please note that the exercise of this right does not automatically result in your personal data being erased. In some cases, we may also be able to demonstrate that we have a compelling legitimate reason to process you information, which override your rights and freedoms.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c13 c16"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="c7 c18">Right to object to automated decision making and profiling</span></span><span class="c3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span> You have the right to request that you are not subject to a decision based exclusively on automated decision making (i.e. without human intervention and participation). In addition, you have the right to be informed about the use of any automated decision making and profiling of your personal data, and to be given meaningful information about the nature of the processing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c13 c16"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="c7 c18">Right to portability</span></span><span class="c3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span> You may request that we transmit your personal data to you or to a third-party controller. We will provide you, or your requested third party, with your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. This right only applies to automated data which you initially provided consent for us to use or that is necessary.</span></p>
